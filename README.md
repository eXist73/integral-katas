## Description
Implementation of the katas described here:
https://github.com/integral-io/katas/tree/master/social-networking

The `dev_box` folder is for virtualization of environment running `node`.
This is not required if you are running a local environment with `node` installed.

For my simplicity, I've created a `users_init.json` which is acting as the `database` for this project.
Since my understanding of `Jest` is new (I'm coming from a PHP / Laravel background) I've taken
this approach.

I really enjoy the concept of TDD and hope I get the opportunity to learn more with you guys and gals!

Thanks,
Chad Fisher.
